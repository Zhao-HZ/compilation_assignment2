# Theory of Computation
# Assignment 2

Test environment in my computer:
```
5.15.153.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2
Python 3.12.7 
```

No other libraries are included in these source codes.

Introduction of each file:
- `dfa.py`: contains the implementation of the deterministic finite automaton.
- `test.py1`: test file in assignment 1.
- `test.py2`: test file in assignment 2.

To test, use the following command in your terminal(Windows, or Mac OS):
```
python test2.py
```

If you are using Linux (Ubuntu), simply run:
```
python3 test2.py
```
in your terminal.

You will see the following result for assignment 2.
```sh

```
